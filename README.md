This repository contains a Tcl procedure designed to count words in a given text string.  However, the initial implementation contains a bug that causes incorrect word counts when the input string has multiple consecutive spaces or leading/trailing spaces. The `bug.tcl` file demonstrates the bug, and the `bugSolution.tcl` demonstrates the fix. The issue stems from the procedure's inability to properly handle scenarios with extra spaces which results in an inaccurate word count. The solution improves the robustness of the word counting mechanism and handles such cases correctly.
